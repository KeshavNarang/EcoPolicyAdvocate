Currently, there are multiple agencies that can provide disaster assistance, and each agency has its own application process. This can be confusing and time-consuming for disaster survivors, who may not know which agency to contact or how to complete the necessary paperwork. H.R. 356 would create a single point of contact for disaster assistance, making it easier for survivors to get the help they need.\n\nAnother important change that H.R. 356 would make is to provide more equitable disaster assistance. Currently, the federal government's disaster assistance programs are often biased against low-income communities and communities of color. H.R. 356 would address this bias by ensuring that disaster assistance is distributed in a fair and equitable manner.\n\nFinally, H.R. 356 would make disaster assistance more effective by providing funding for long-term recovery efforts.
