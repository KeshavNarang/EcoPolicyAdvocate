These regimes are both authoritarian and repressive, and they have a history of human rights abuses. They are also both major exporters of oil and gas, and their exports have helped to prop up their economies.\n\nThe United States has a national interest in reducing its dependence on foreign oil and gas. This bill would help to achieve that goal by prohibiting the importation of oil and gas from Venezuela and Iran. It would also send a strong message to these regimes that the United States will not tolerate their support for terrorism and their repression of their own people.\n\nI urge you to support H.R. 7688 and help to make it law.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]", "s2986-118": "To prohibit the issuance of an interim or final rule, and to prohibit the inclusion in certain oil and gas leases, exploration or development plans, or well permits requirements or recommendations, that establish a vessel speed or operational restriction in the Central or Western Planning Area of the Gulf of Mexico of the outer Continental Shelf until the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce complete a study demonstrating that proposed mitigation efforts would have no negative impact on supply chains, United States offshore energy production and generation, military activities, including readiness, and United States commercial and recreational fishing maritime commerce, and for other purposes.\n\nThe undersigned, [your name], [your address], [your city, state, zip code], respectfully submit the following comments on [bill title].\n\nWe are writing to express our strong opposition to [bill title]. This bill would prohibit the issuance of an interim or final rule, and to prohibit the inclusion in certain oil and gas leases, exploration or development plans, or well permits requirements or recommendations, that establish a vessel speed or operational restriction in the Central or Western Planning Area of the Gulf of Mexico of the outer Continental Shelf until the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce complete a study demonstrating that proposed mitigation efforts would have no negative impact on supply chains, United States offshore energy production and generation, military activities, including readiness, and United States commercial and recreational fishing maritime commerce.\n\nWe believe that this bill is unnecessary and would have a negative impact on the economy of the Gulf Coast region. The Gulf of Mexico is a major source of oil and gas production for the United States, and a vessel speed or operational restriction would have a significant impact on the ability of companies to operate in this region. This would lead to higher costs for consumers and could put jobs at risk.\n\nIn addition, we believe that this bill would have a negative impact on the military. The Gulf of Mexico is a critical training area for the Navy and Marine Corps, and a vessel speed or operational restriction would make it more difficult for them to conduct training exercises. This could put our national security at risk.\n\nFinally, we believe that this bill would have a negative impact on commercial and recreational fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. A vessel speed or operational restriction would make it more difficult for fishermen to operate in this region, and could lead to job losses.\n\nFor all of these reasons, we urge you to oppose [bill title].\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.", "hr5792-118": "The U.S. House of Representatives is considering a bill that would provide whistleblower protections to certain workers in the offshore oil and gas industry. The bill, H.R. 2564, would create a new whistleblower protection program for employees of offshore oil and gas production facilities. The program would provide protection for employees who report violations of federal law, regulations, or contract requirements.\n\nThe bill is supported by a number of labor unions and environmental groups. They argue that the bill is necessary to protect workers from retaliation for reporting safety violations or other illegal activities.\n\nThe oil and gas industry opposes the bill. They argue that the bill would create a burdensome regulatory regime that would discourage investment in the offshore oil and gas industry.\n\nThe public is invited to submit comments on the bill.

This bill would provide much-needed whistleblower protections for workers in the offshore oil and gas industry.\n\nWhistleblowers play a vital role in protecting the public from unsafe and illegal activities. They often come forward with information about serious safety violations, environmental hazards, and other wrongdoing. However, whistleblowers often face retaliation from their employers for reporting these problems.\n\nH.R. 2564 would provide whistleblowers with the protections they need to come forward with information about wrongdoing. The bill would create a new whistleblower protection program for employees of offshore oil and gas production facilities. The program would provide protection for employees who report violations of federal law, regulations, or contract requirements.\n\nThe bill would also provide whistleblowers with a number of other protections, including protection from retaliation, anti-retaliation counseling, and legal assistance.\n\nI urge you to support H.R. 2564 and help to protect whistleblowers in the offshore oil and gas industry.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]", "hr5373-118": "The following is a template for public commenting on a bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to increase the civil and criminal penalties for oil spills.\n\nDear [Name of Member of Congress],\n\nI am writing to express my support for the bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to increase the civil and criminal penalties for oil spills.\n\nOil spills are a serious environmental and economic problem. They can pollute our waterways, damage wildlife, and harm our economy. The current penalties for oil spills are not enough to deter companies from taking risks that could lead to a spill.\n\nIncreasing the penalties for oil spills would send a strong message to companies that they will be held accountable for their actions.

I believe that the insurance industry has a responsibility to play a role in addressing climate change, and this bill would help to do that by requiring insurance companies to disclose their investments and underwriting in the fossil fuel industry.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry is a major contributor to climate change, and its activities are putting our communities at risk. In recent years, we have seen an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires. These events are caused by climate change, and they are having a devastating impact on our communities.\n\nIn addition to the physical risks, climate change is also having a negative impact on our economy. The cost of weather-related disasters is rising, and businesses are struggling to adapt to the changing climate.\n\nThe insurance industry has a responsibility to help address climate change.

However, the exemption for aggregation of emissions from oil and gas sources has allowed these sources to avoid taking responsibility for their full emissions. This exemption has allowed oil and gas companies to pollute our air without facing the consequences.\n\nThe bill to eliminate the exemption for aggregation of emissions from oil and gas sources would close this loophole and ensure that these sources are held accountable for their pollution.
