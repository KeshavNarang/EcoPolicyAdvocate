In the 1970s, we were the world's leading producer of solar cells. However, in recent years, we have lost our competitive edge. China now produces more than 80% of the world's solar cells, and many of the components used in solar panels are made in China or other foreign countries.\n\nThis dependence on foreign sources of supply is a problem for several reasons. First, it makes us vulnerable to supply disruptions. If there is a problem with production in China, it could have a major impact on the solar industry in the United States. Second, it costs more to import solar components than it does to produce them domestically. This makes it more difficult for American companies to compete in the global market.\n\nThe Solar Manufacturing Act of 2023 would help to address these problems by providing grants and loans to support and expand the domestic solar component manufacturing supply chain. This funding would help American companies to invest in new manufacturing facilities and equipment, and it would create jobs in the solar industry.\n\nIn addition to creating jobs and boosting economic growth, the Solar Manufacturing Act of 2023 would also help us reduce our reliance on foreign sources of energy.
