				&emsp;&emsp;Inspired by Elizabeth Anderson's essay, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/episteme/article/abs/democracy/public-policy/and-lay-assessments/of-scientific-testimony1/C96369F581A9091635E522D4ED671DBE" target="_blank">"Democracy, Public Policy, and Lay Assessments of Scientific Testimony"</a>, the EcoPolicyAdvocate was created with a mission to simplify and scale environmental advocacy efforts for all. The EcoPolicyAdvocate was designed to address a tension between two key demands in American society â€“ that public policies be empirically responsible and that they be democratically legitimate. 
			</p>
			<p class="hidden">
				&emsp;&emsp; In the context of the environment, a challenge arises because ordinary citizens often face difficulties comprehending scientific research and engaging with technical public policies. I created the EcoPolicyAdvocate, in partnership with multiple local, national, and international organizations, to be an all-in-one bill tracker that analyzes new legislation on a daily basis. Powered by Generative AI, the website summarizes and categorizes bills by relevant tags, which you can filter based on your interests, and creates templates for messages that you can send to your representatives, urging them to take action.
			</p>
			<p class="hidden">
				&emsp;&emsp; Our vision is 1) for nonprofits to integrate this and alleviate burden in collaboration and 2) make this a one-stop resource for advocates everywhere to learn more about technical topics and prepare powerful, informed comments for everything from written emails to elected officials to speeches at local officials. We are working hard and with transparency to keep improving, so visit our suggest changes to see how we will improve and share your own ideas, or if you are a nonprofit or would like to speak, contact. For your privacy, no data is collected.

		<h2>News and Suggestions</h2>

			<p>&emsp;&emsp; 1) We are working on incorporating ZIP code, so that messages can be more personalized to your representatives specifically, including their position on the bill. </p>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp; 2) We are working on creating forums with a page for each bill so that you can ask questions, experts can answer, and others who are involved can share more details to harness power of activist community. </p>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp; 3) We are working with nonprofits to fact-check and ensure accuracy and trust in AI, perhaps including their own modifications for bills and multiple, improved templates. </p>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp; 4) We are working on creating accounts so that a community can be fostered. You will be able to meet and connect with other climate activists, find and invite individuals from your organization, and star bills you would like your members to focus on. </p>
